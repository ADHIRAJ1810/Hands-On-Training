Set of Assumptions

1. Donor is going to able to negotiate payment frequency/Amount to donate/years before starting doantion only.

2. Donor has to complete installments serially(Datewise).

3. For Mass Donation, user has no installments in cancelled/pending status.
   If so: complete latest installment then go for mass doantion for remaining.

4. If all installments are pending : Complete Donation is Pending.

5. If user paid certain amount installment/Donation status: Partially Completed
   for ex:- if donor missed nth installment and directly showed up for (n+1)th installment
			he/she has to pay/donate/complete nth installment first

6. Donor cannot mass donate at the time of the First installment.

Precautions

1. For mass donation user has to carefully put due amount in the field.
